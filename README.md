# Time Server

Just a project to refresh my knowledge about fundamental concepts in C and networking as I have mostly been playing around with Python and Go and forgot a lot of stuff.  
This is just a simple server that tells the current time. I want to make one version using child processes per request and one that uses threads instead.
